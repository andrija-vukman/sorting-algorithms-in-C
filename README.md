In this project the main focus has been to learn and understand all major sorting algorithms by writing them myself in the C programming language.
There was absolutely no use of AI or Copy-Paste.
The only help used were descriptions about the functionality of each algorithm.


The project is structured in ...

... a header file (see sort.h)
... a kind of main file (see sort.c)
... each algorithm in a seperate file (see functions/\*.c)
... some other necessary functions used (see functions/\*.c)


Please take into account that this project is not finished, since a programming project is never finished per se. Some passages can be written in a much more efficient way.
Why didn't I write it more efficient?
Because the purpose of it is to illustrate my progress and give a starting point as a reference.

Thank you!
